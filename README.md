# m4twitterproject

  This project uses jQuery and Handlebars to make a twitter page. The user is able to click on a text area which expands upon click,
enter text, and submit a tweet. The user is than able to reply to tweets and create new ones. The html is created by
Handlebars templating to dynamically add new divs to the page. None of the data is stored so refresh the page and it 
begins again!
